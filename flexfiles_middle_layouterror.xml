  <t>
    If the client is using NFSv4.2 to communicate with the
    metadata server, then instead of waiting for a LAYOUTRETURN
    to send error information to the metadata server (see
    <xref target='ss:return:errors' />), it MAY use LAYOUTERROR (see
    Section 15.6 of <xref target='RFC7862' />)
    to communicate that information. For the flexible files layout type,
    this means that LAYOUTERROR4args is treated the same as ff_ioerr4.
