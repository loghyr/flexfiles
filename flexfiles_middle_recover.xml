<section title="Recovering from Client I/O Errors">
  <t>
    The pNFS client may encounter errors when directly accessing
    the storage devices.  However, it is the responsibility of the
    metadata server to recover from the I/O errors.  When the
    LAYOUT4_FLEX_FILES layout type is used, the client MUST report
    the I/O errors to the server at LAYOUTRETURN time using the
    ff_ioerr structure (see <xref target="ff_ioerr" />).
  </t>

  <t>
    The metadata server analyzes the error and determines the
    required recovery operations such as repairing any parity
    inconsistencies, recovering media failures, or reconstructing
    missing objects.
  </t>

  <t>
    The metadata server SHOULD recall any outstanding layouts to
    allow it exclusive write access to the stripes being recovered
    and to prevent other clients from hitting the same error
    condition.  In these cases, the server MUST complete recovery
    before handing out any new layouts to the affected byte ranges.
  </t>

  <t>
    Although it MAY be acceptable for the client to propagate a
    corresponding error to the application that initiated the I/O
    operation and drop any unwritten data, the client SHOULD attempt
    to retry the original I/O operation by requesting a new layout
    using LAYOUTGET and retry the I/O operation(s) using the new
    layout, or the client MAY just retry the I/O operation(s) using
    regular NFS READ or WRITE operations via the metadata server.
    The client SHOULD attempt to retrieve a new layout and retry
    the I/O operation using the storage device first and only if the
    error persists, retry the I/O operation via the metadata server.
  </t>
