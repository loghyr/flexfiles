<section title="Recovering from Client I/O Errors">
  <t>
    The pNFS client may encounter errors when directly accessing
    the storage devices.  However, it is the responsibility of the
    metadata server to recover from the I/O errors.  When the
    LAYOUT4_FLEX_FILES layout type is used, the client MUST report
    the I/O errors to the server at LAYOUTRETURN time using the
    ff_ioerr4 structure (see <xref target="ff_ioerr4" />).
  </t>

  <t>
    The metadata server analyzes the error and determines the
    required recovery operations such as recovering media failures
    or reconstructing missing data files.
  </t>

  <t>
    The metadata server MUST recall any outstanding layouts to
    allow it exclusive write access to the stripes being recovered
    and to prevent other clients from hitting the same error
    condition.  In these cases, the server MUST complete recovery
    before handing out any new layouts to the affected byte ranges.
  </t>

  <t>
    Although the client implementation has the option  to propagate
    a corresponding error to the application that initiated the I/O
    operation and drop any unwritten data, the client should attempt to
    retry the original I/O operation by either requesting a new layout or
    sending the I/O via regular NFSv4.1+ READ or WRITE operations to the
    metadata server.  The client SHOULD attempt to retrieve a new layout
    and retry the I/O operation using the storage device first and only if
    the error persists, retry the I/O operation via the metadata server.
  </t>
