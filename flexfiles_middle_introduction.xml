    In pNFS, the file server returns typed layout structures that
    describe where file data is located.
    There are different layouts for different storage systems and methods
    of arranging data on storage devices.
    This document defines the layout used with file-based data servers
    that are accessed using the Network File System (NFS) Protocol:
    NFSv3 (<xref target="RFC1813" />), NFSv4
    (<xref target="RFC3530" />) and its newer minor version -
    NFSv4.1 (<xref target="RFC5661" />).
  </t>

  <t>
    In contrast to the LAYOUT4_NFSV4_1_FILES layout type
    (<xref target="RFC5661" />)
    that also uses NFSv4.1 to access the data server,
    the Flexible Files layout defines a model of device metadata and
    striping patterns that is inspired by the object layout
    (<xref target="RFC5664" />)
    that provide flexible, per-file striping patterns and simple device
    information suitable aggregating standalone NFS servers into
    a centrally managed pNFS cluster.
  </t>

  <t>
    To provide a global state model equivalent to that of the files layout
    a back-end control protocol may be implemented between the metadata
    server (MDS) and NFSv4.1 data servers (DSs).
    It is out of scope for this document to specify the wire protocol
    of such a protocol, yet the requirements for the protocol are specified in
    <xref target="RFC5661" /> and clarified in <xref target='pNFSLayouts' />.
