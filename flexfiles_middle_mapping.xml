<section title="Striping via Sparse Mapping" anchor="sec:sparseStriping">
  <t>
    While other Layout Types support both dense and sparse mapping
    of logical offsets to phyisical offsets within a file (see for
    example Section 13.4 of <xref target='RFC5661' />), the Flexible
    File Layout Type only supports a sparse mapping.
  </t>

  <t>
    With sparse mappings, the logical offset within a file (L)
    is also the physical offset on the storage device. As detailed
    in Section 13.4.4 of <xref target='RFC5661' />, this results
    in holes across each storage device which does not contain
    the current stripe index.

L: logical offset into the file

W: stripe width
    W = number of elements in ffm_data_servers

S: number of bytes in a stripe
    S = W * ffl_stripe_unit

N: stripe number
    N = L / S
