<section title="Striping Topologies Extensibility">
  <t>
    New striping topologies that are not specified in this document
    may be specified using @@@.

    These must be documented in the IETF by submitting an RFC augmenting
    this protocol provided that:

    <list style='symbols'>
      <t>
        New striping topologies MUST be wire-protocol compatible with the
        Flexible Files Layout protocol as specified in this document.
      </t>

      <t>
        Some members of the data structures specified here may be declared
        as optional or manadatory-not-to-be-used.
      </t>

      <t>
        Upon acceptance by the IETF as a RFC, new striping topology constants
        MUST be registered as describe in <xref target="sec:iana" />.
      </t>
    </list>
  </t>
</section>

<section anchor="sec:iana" title="IANA Considerations">
  <t>
    As described in <xref target="RFC5661" />,
    new layout type numbers have been assigned by IANA.
    This document defines the protocol associated with the existing
    layout type number, LAYOUT4_FLEX_FILES.
  </t>

  <t>
    A new IANA registry should be assigned to register new data map striping
    topologies described by the enumerated type: @@@.
