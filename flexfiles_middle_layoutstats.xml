  <t>
    If the client is using NFSv4.2 to communicate with the
    metadata server, then instead of waiting for a LAYOUTRETURN
    to send I/O statistics to the metadata server (see
    <xref target='ss:return:stats' />), it MAY use LAYOUTSTATS (see
    Section 15.7 of <xref target='NFSv42' />)
    to communicate that information. For the Flexible Files Layout Type,
    this means that LAYOUTSTATS4args.lsa_layoutupdate is overloaded
    with the same contents as in ffis_layoutupdate.
